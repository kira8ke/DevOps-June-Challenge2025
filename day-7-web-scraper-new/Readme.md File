# Day 7: Simple Web Scraper with Docker 🕸️🐳

This is **Day 7** of my [DevOps June Challenge 2025](https://github.com/kira8ke/DevOps-June-Challenge2025).  
The goal was to build a simple web scraper using Python and Docker.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for scraping web content.
- How to containerize a Python script using Docker.
- How to write and manage a basic `Dockerfile`.
- Importance of using `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t day-7-web-scraper .

# Run the container
docker run day-7-web-scraper
📜 Output
If the website is accessible, you'll see the title printed like this:

Website Title: Example Domain
💡 Notes
This scraper is basic and designed for learning.

Always check a website's robots.txt and terms of service before scraping.
